macro:->Census
data
is
published
on
many
websites.
I've
used
\url
{https://nhgis.org/},
as
it
allows
you
to
just
download
the
columns
you
want
and
not
waste
hard
drive
space
or
time
processing
lots
of
data.
The
census
supplies
``shapefiles"
of
the
different
geographical
areas
they
use
at
\url
{https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/tiger-line.html},
including
tracts.
The
city
of
New
York
supplies
shapefiles
that
clip
to
the
shoreline
at
\url
{http://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/data-maps/open-data/districts-download-metadata.page},
as
the
census
tracts
are
defined
so
that
they
include
all
river
areas
and
much
of
the
ocean.
I
expect
that
the
census
needs
to
be
prepared
for
houseboats
and
changing
shorelines.
