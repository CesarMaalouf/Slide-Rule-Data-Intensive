<!--l. 39--><p class="indent" >   In 1937, in response to traffic congestion, New York City began regulating
for-hire cars by limiting the total number of vehicles (yellow cabs) that can
legally pick up passengers hailed from the street. This has created a
system which many say is unfair to those who do not live within the core
business district, as accepted wisdom says that unmet demand is high
enough within the core business district that there is no incentive for
drivers to leave it. Recently, the advent of other for-hire vehicles in NYC
has brought further attention to issues with yellow cabs service across
geographic, income, and ethnic groups. The city has started a system of
so called &#8220;boro cabs&#8221;, which are allowed to pick up street hails only
outside of a defined central business district. Smartphone hailing apps
manage to bypass the regulation scheme based upon street hails, providing
significant competition to yellow cabs, along with claims that they better
serve poorer neighborhoods. Along with the conventional wisdom about
the locations where cabs can be hailed, there are also other common
tropes about cab coverage, such as a bias against non-white passengers
and that they are only used by the rich. In order to answer any of these
questions, we first have to understand the basic demographics of taxicab
riders.
<!--l. 47--><p class="indent" >   According to my analysis, the most important factor governing taxi-cab usage
is income. More specifically, I find that the number of taxicab drop-offs in a given
area per-capita is proportional to the square of the per-capita income in that
area.
<!--l. 50--><p class="indent" >   To understand taxicab usage in NYC, I took a look at the data released by
                                                                     

                                                                     
the NYC Taxi and Livery Cab Commission detailing all the roughly
150 million metered taxi trip taken by licensed NYC cabs, commonly
known as yellow cabs. This data includes longitude and latitude points for
the drop-off and pickup locations of each trip. I compare the drop-offs
to demographic data on residents from the U.S Census Bureau that is
split up by census tract, which in NYC usually encompasses just a few
blocks. I counted the number of drop-offs in each census tract so that I
could compare the number of drop-offs to the demographic data from the
census.
<!--l. 55--><p class="indent" >   The map below shows New York City, with darker areas indicating
a higher number of total drop-offs during 2013 and lighter lower. The
darkest area of the map is the central business district of NYC, midtown
Manhattan, with the two airports showing up as the black spots to the right of
Manhattan.

<!--l. 68--><p class="indent" >   Note that I removed Staten Island, the island on the lower left of the
map, from my analysis. Staten Island is extremely demographically and
economically distinct from the rest of New York City, so much so that
Staten Island actually voted in a referendum to secede from the city in
1993.
<!--l. 70--><p class="indent" >   By looking at the demographics of the locations where drop-offs occur, we can
try to gain a bit of understanding of the demographic factors that effect
ridership. It&#8217;s important to note though that not every drop-off represents
someone getting dropped off at their home, so the location of drop-offs will not
directly tell us who is taking taxis - far from it. This is clear if you look the few
areas, such as central park and major transit hubs such as Penn Station
and Grand Central which have drop-off rates orders of magnitude above
the rest of the pack. This large number of drop-offs does not come from
residents, but from people from all over the city traveling to these popular
destinations. The mantra that correlation does not imply causation is
probably worth repeating here, and it may be that a model based only on
demographic factors is only useful as a first step to a more complete
model rather that one where we should be making decisions right off the
bat.
<!--l. 86--><p class="indent" >   To do this analysis, I first studied correlations between the number of
drop-offs and the various demographic features of each census tract in order to
select out the demographic features which did the best job at predicting the
number of drop-offs. This indicated that the income of each census tract is highly
correlated with the number of drop-offs, so I performed a regression to
                                                                     

                                                                     
find how exactly income is related to drop-offs. The regression indicated
that

<!--l. 91--><p class="nopar" >
<!--l. 93--><p class="indent" >   When I say that the number of drop-offs per-capita is proportional to the
square of the per-capita income, what this is really saying is something about the
<span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">average </span>number of drop-offs. If we have a bunch of census tracts with the exact
same per-capita income, we would not expect them all to have the exact same
number of drop-offs per-capita. Instead, the model says that they will all have
different drop-offs per-capita, but their average will follow equation <a 
href="#x1-2r1">1<!--tex4ht:ref: eq:PoissonFit --></a>. The model
also gives a fairly specific description of how many tracts we&#8217;d expect to deviate
from the average by how much, and this is where we start running into
problems.
<!--l. 98--><p class="indent" >   For the sake of comparison, lets imagine a New York where the probability of
a taxicab dropping somebody off in a given census tract at any time
depended on one thing, and one thing only - the per-capita income in that
census tract. In this imaginary world, if we looked at two census tracts
with the exact same income, we wouldn&#8217;t expect them to have the exact
same number of drop-offs within a year, but we would expect them to be
pretty close. The thing is, if we look at two census tracts with similar
per-capita incomes in the real data, the number of drop-offs is a whole lot
less close than we&#8217;d expect if per-capita income was the only thing that
mattered.
<!--l. 102--><p class="indent" >   This means that there must be something other than per-capita income that
matters here. Frankly, that&#8217;s not surprising - if I told you that per-capita income
really was the <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">only </span>thing that mattered, it would be much more shocking. The
thing is that our data is <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">so </span>much farther apart than we&#8217;d expect if per-capita
                                                                     

                                                                     
income was the only thing that mattered - about half a million times farther
apart. This means that there must be a whole lot more important factors that
come in to play.
<!--l. 107--><p class="indent" >   However, using just income does do a pretty good job of explaining
things. On a scale that goes from not explaining anything at all to
explaining everything perfectly, using just income gets us about 65%
of the way to perfect - or for those who are familiar with regression,
<span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">R</span><sup><span 
class="cmr-8">2</span></sup> = 0<span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">.</span>65<a 
 id="x1-3r1"></a><span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="NonTechnical2.html#fn1x0"><sup class="textsuperscript">1</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-4f1"></a> .
That&#8217;s a whole lot of the way to perfect using just a single variable.
<!--l. 113--><p class="indent" >   Which other factors are important is still an open question. A bunch of the
possibilities are things that should be able to get data for such as the number of
people who&#8217;s place of work is in a given area, whether or not the residents
commute in cars, or how far the area is from the city center. But there also
are plenty of factors that we can&#8217;t hope to measure using a data driven
approach, such as the presence of cultural institutions or a school dorm
full of students who may be a whole lot wealthier than their income
suggests.
<!--l. 117--><p class="indent" >   Some of the factors that might be involved can&#8217;t be seen by looking at the
demographics of residents, like how many people&#8217;s jobs are in a census tract. And
some of the factors are things that we can&#8217;t expect to see directly, like the
presence of cultural institutions. However, many of the things that we may not be
able to measure directly may have indirect effects on data that we can measure.
It could be that this is the reason that income is particularly useful, as factors
like race, local employment, and cultural institutions are all correlated with
income.
<!--l. 125--><p class="indent" >   It is also important to not take . I am looking at the demographics of the
locations where drop-offs occur, not directly at the demographics of passengers,
which could be dramatically different from data I&#8217;m measuring, especially if
income is
<!--l. 133--><p class="indent" >   Based on this analysis, we can see that per-capita income is an impressive
predictor for taxicab drop-offs, with a pseudo-<span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">R</span><span 
class="cmr-8">2</span>of 0.65. However, the high
dispersion parameter, along with the poor fit of the deviance residuals to a
normal distribution indicates that the model may still have much room
for improvement. A possible avenue may be adding more demographic
predictors, such as the average commute time, car usage, spatial position, or
                                                                     

                                                                     
the racial make-up of census tracts. Borough, which may be a rough
proxy for any of these possible predictors can be seen to correlate will
with drop-offs in Figure&#x00A0;<span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">??</span>. However, while there may be interesting
information to be gleaned from exploring which predictors are the most
successful, the room for improvement in this model largely lies in the
distribution of the predicted error, and thus would probably be relatively
marginal.
<!--l. 138--><p class="indent" >   It is also possible that no improvement can be achieved from a demographic
data based approach. It may be that the effect from factors like transit hubs and
cultural institutions that are particular to each individual census tract cannot be
fully expressed through demographic data, and may not be able to be reasonably
tracked by any data.
<!--l. 141--><p class="indent" >   I, for one, find the simplicity of this model appealing: per-capita dropoffs are
proportional to the square of per-capita income. While there are clearly more
details, the simple take away here is very satisfying.
